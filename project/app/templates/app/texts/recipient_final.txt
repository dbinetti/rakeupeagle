Just a final note that our Rake Up Eagle team will arrive at your house tomorrow, Saturday the 13th, between 8-11AM.  We have your address as {{recipient.location}}.  They will knock at the door when they arrive, but can not enter.  Be sure all pets remain inside.  They will bring all equipment and place bags in the normal pickup area.  Reply to this message with any questions.  See you tomorrow!
