    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ul class='list-styled'>
    <li>
      If you have any questions, needs, or concerns, please call <strong>(847) 347-1579</strong>.  In particular, call if you believe the yard is too big or too small for your group so we can adjust as necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
      Please have leader of group knock on door so they know you have arrived.   <strong>Do not enter the home.</strong>  You are only giving them a heads up that your group has arrived.
    </li>
    <li>
      Put all filled leaf bags at the end of the driveway (or in the normal garbage collection area.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Need more lawn bags?   Head back to EMS or call for a delivery.    Please note that someone over 18 has to be at the residence the entire time of raking.  <strong>Do not leave youth alone at the recipient's home.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      If you take any group photos, please send them to <a href='mailto://support@rakeupeagle.com'>support@rakeupeagle.com</a> so we put them in our EMS yearbook, Facebook page, and perhaps in Eagle Life Magazine!
    </li>
    <li>
      If the recipient has a dog it needs to remain inside.  If you see any animal waste, please leave and head back to EMS for a different assignment.
    </li>
